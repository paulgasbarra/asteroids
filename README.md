# Paul's Asteroids

This project was begun as part of [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) side project. I've continued to expand it. It is for fun only.

I'm using sound effects from [Adobe's Sound Library](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition/offers/adobeauditiondlcsfx.html) and a font called ["Screaming Neon"](https://www.1001fonts.com/screaming-neon-font.html#license) designed by Michael W. Moss.
